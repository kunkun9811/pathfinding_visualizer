/* Top Priority */
*** PrevNode for Dijkstra has problem 
(1) When running algorithm, prevent modification of the grid


/* Process of dealing with Dijkstra's visualizer */
(1) Run the Dijkstra's algorithm. At the same time, keep track of the order of visited nodes [list].
(2) Visualize the Dijkstra's algorithm by following the list.
(3) Visualize the shortest path after (2)

/* Some extra features or implementations */
- on line 7 in PathfindingVisualizer, potentially change these intial values with some math like divide by 2
